## Usage

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the solution:

### 1. Clone the Repository from GitHub:  
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonathanscholtes/Azure-AI-RAG-Architecture-React-FastAPI-and-Cosmos-DB-Vector-Store.git
cd Azure-AI-RAG-Architecture-React-FastAPI-and-Cosmos-DB-Vector-Store
```

### 2. Deploy the Solution Using Bicep:  
Navigate to the deployment directory:

```bash
cd deploy
```

Then, use the following PowerShell command to deploy the solution. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual subscription name, Azure Region (ResourceGroupLocation), CosmosDB for MongoDB vCore username, and password:

**PowerShell**
```bash
.\deploy.ps1 -Subscription '[Subscription Name]' -ResourceGroupLocation 'southcentralus' -CosmosadminUsername '[Username to create for CosmosDB]' -CosmosadminPassword '[Password to Create for CosmosDB]'
```

This script will provision the necessary resources in your Azure subscription according to the specified parameters. The deployment may take upto **30 minutes** to provision all Azure resources.

### 3. Configure Storage Account Access:  
After deployment, it's essential to allow access to the Storage Account facilitate document uploads for embedding creation. To do this, you will need to add your client IP address to the Storage Account’s firewall settings. This ensures that your local environment can communicate with the Azure services properly.

- Log in to the Azure portal.
- Navigate to your Storage Account.
- Under the **Networking** section, locate the **Firewall and virtual networks** settings.
- Add your current client IP address to the list of allowed addresses.

### 5. Validate Embedding Load in Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB vCore
To verify the successful loading of the documents, use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) or a similar tool.

##### Configure Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB vCore Access:
To Validate with [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) you will need to add your client IP address to Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB vCore firewall settings.

- Log in to the Azure portal.
- Navigate to your Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB vCore.
- Under the **Networking** section, locate the **Public access** settings.
- Add your current client IP address to the list of allowed addresses.

## Clean-Up

After completing testing, ensure to delete any unused Azure resources or remove the entire Resource Group to avoid incurring additional charges.

### Resource Purge for Redeployment

If you plan to delete and redeploy this solution, you may need to manually purge specific Azure resources, including **Azure API Management (APIM)** and **Azure OpenAI** services, as they may retain certain configurations even after deletion.

#### Azure OpenAI Purge

To permanently delete an Azure OpenAI or other Azure AI service, follow [these steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/recover-purge-resources?tabs=azure-portal#purge-a-deleted-resource):

1. **Navigate to the Azure AI Service Hub**:  
   Go to the hub of the Azure AI service associated with the deleted resource. For instance, if you need to purge an "Anomaly Detector" resource, search for "Anomaly Detector" in the Azure portal search bar, select the service, and then choose **Manage Deleted Resources** from the menu.

2. **Select the Subscription and Deleted Resource**:  
   In the **Manage Deleted Resources** section, choose the relevant subscription from the dropdown list, then locate and select the deleted resource(s) you wish to purge.

3. **Purge the Resource**:  
   Click **Purge** to permanently delete the selected resource(s). Be aware that purging is irreversible and removes all associated configurations and data for the resource.

#### APIM Purge

To manually delete an Azure API Management (APIM) service, use the following command, substituting your **Subscription ID**, **Region**, and **APIM Resource Name**:

```bash
az rest --method delete --url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/[Subscription ID]/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/locations/[Region]/deletedservices/[APIM Resource Name]?api-version=2021-08-01
