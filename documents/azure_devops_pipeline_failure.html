<h1>Azure DevOps Pipeline Build Failure</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Azure DevOps pipeline builds can fail due to various reasons such as syntax errors in YAML files, missing dependencies, or misconfigured tasks. These failures can prevent the successful execution of the pipeline and impact the overall development process. To resolve these issues, it is crucial to investigate the build logs and ensure proper environment setup.</p>

<p>When a build fails, it is important to identify the root cause and take appropriate actions to fix it. This troubleshooting guide provides step-by-step instructions to help you resolve Azure DevOps pipeline build failures effectively.</p>

<h2>Possible Error Messages:</h2>
<p>1. "Error: Invalid YAML syntax"</p>
<p>2. "Task failed: Missing required input: [input_name]"</p>
<p>3. "Dependency not found: [dependency_name]"</p>
<p>4. "Build agent not available"</p>
<p>5. "Task execution timeout"</p>

<h2>Resolution Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Check the build logs for any error messages or warnings. Look for specific error codes or keywords that can help identify the issue.</li>
  <li>Review the YAML file for any syntax errors. YAML files are sensitive to indentation and formatting, so ensure that the file is properly structured.</li>
  <li>Verify that all required dependencies are installed and up to date. Check for any missing or outdated packages that the pipeline relies on.</li>
  <li>Inspect the task configurations in the pipeline. Ensure that all inputs and parameters are correctly defined and match the requirements of the tasks.</li>
  <li>Check the availability and connectivity of the build agent. Ensure that the agent is online and properly configured to execute the pipeline.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Next Steps:</h2>
<p>After following the resolution steps mentioned above, re-run the pipeline build to see if the issue has been resolved. Monitor the build logs and verify that the build completes successfully without any errors or warnings. If the issue persists, consider seeking assistance from your team or Azure DevOps support.</p>
