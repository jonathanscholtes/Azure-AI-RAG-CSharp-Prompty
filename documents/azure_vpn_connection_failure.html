<h1>Azure Virtual Network Gateway VPN Connection Failure</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Azure Virtual Network Gateway VPN connection failures often occur due to configuration mismatches, certificate issues, or incorrect pre-shared keys. These failures can prevent successful establishment of a VPN connection between an on-premises network and an Azure virtual network. To resolve this issue, it is crucial to ensure proper alignment between the on-premises and Azure configurations.</p>
<p>Configuration mismatches can arise from differences in settings such as IP address ranges, subnet masks, or encryption protocols. Certificate issues may occur if the certificates used for authentication are expired, revoked, or not properly installed. Incorrect pre-shared keys can also lead to connection failures if the keys do not match on both ends of the VPN tunnel.</p>

<h2>Possible Error Messages:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Error message 1: "The VPN connection failed due to a configuration mismatch."</li>
  <li>Error message 2: "The VPN connection failed due to certificate issues."</li>
  <li>Error message 3: "The VPN connection failed due to incorrect pre-shared keys."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resolution Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Verify the configuration settings on both the on-premises VPN device and the Azure Virtual Network Gateway. Ensure that the IP address ranges, subnet masks, and encryption protocols match.</li>
  <li>Check the certificates used for authentication. Ensure that they are not expired, revoked, or improperly installed. If necessary, renew or re-install the certificates.</li>
  <li>Double-check the pre-shared keys used for authentication. Make sure that they are identical on both the on-premises VPN device and the Azure Virtual Network Gateway.</li>
  <li>Restart the on-premises VPN device and the Azure Virtual Network Gateway to refresh the connection.</li>
  <li>If the issue persists, review the VPN logs on both ends to identify any specific error codes or messages. These logs can provide valuable insights into the root cause of the connection failure.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Next Steps:</h2>
<p>If the above resolution steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to Azure support for further assistance. They can provide additional guidance and troubleshooting steps specific to your environment.</p>
